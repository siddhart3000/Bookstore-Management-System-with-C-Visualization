📚 Bookstore Management System with DSA & Visualization
Duration: June 2024 – July 2024
Tech Stack: C++, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), HTML, CSS

📝 Project Overview
This project showcases a Bookstore Management System developed using C++ with an emphasis on optimized Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
It features a simple yet efficient backend logic combined with a visualization layer in HTML and CSS, allowing users to interact with the system through a web interface.

🎯 Key Features
✅ Add New Book — Store book details using Linked List (sorted by ID)

✅ Search Book by ID — Efficient retrieval using traversal logic

✅ Update Book Details — Modify quantity, title, or author information

✅ Delete Book — Remove book entries from the list

✅ Purchase Book — Simulate a purchase and push details onto a Stack (recent purchases)

✅ View Recent Purchases — Display using LIFO logic

✅ Visualization Layer — Frontend built with HTML/CSS to display operations in a user-friendly interface
